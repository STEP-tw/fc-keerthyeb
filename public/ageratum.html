          Ageratum, (whiteweed in the USA), is a genus of 40[3] to 60 tropical
          and warm temperate flowering annuals and perennials from the family
          Asteraceae, tribe Eupatorieae. Most species are native to Central
          America and Mexico but four are native to the United States. They form
          tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height of 30 in. The opposite
          leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or tomentose. The margins are
          slightly toothed or serrate. The leaves form compact clusters. The
          fluffy flowers are lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white; and spread in
          small compound umbels. They give small, dry fruits.
